Here's a short list of things we can do
=======================================

efyj
----

- Add a global class, efyj::environment for example, to store global
  state like verbose|quiet mode, terminal output stream with color
  etc. Use std::shared\_ptr and std::make\_shared to store the global
  class or static pointer.

Solver & Cache
--------------

- Add an MPI and a thread mode for every solver and cache

- Refactor source code. Some algorithms duplicated.

- Bigmem and hash are cache, perhaps rename/refactor them.

Parser
------

- Convert efjy::dexi::options from std::vector <std::string> into
  std::vector <std::uint8_t> in order to represent correctly the
  option.
